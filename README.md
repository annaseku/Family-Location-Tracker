  # Family Location Tracker
  A web application to track the real-time 'home status' of family members. Was inspired to build this for my own family as a way to keep updated of our home/not home status without having to share specific locations with eachother. 
  
  Frontend built with Vite and Tailwind CSS using Figma. Backend built with Supabase.

  ## Deploying this project
  This project can be deployed using Vercel or Netlify for the frontend and Supabase for the backend. 
  
  Refer to `sample.env` for the required environment variables, and create a `.env` file in the root of the project with your own Supabase URL and Anon Key.

  ## Running the code

  Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.
